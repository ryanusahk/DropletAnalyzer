# DropletAnalyzer
Quantify fluorescence in droplet microfluidics experiments using machine vision (OpenCV 3)

## Dependencies
- Python 2.7
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- OpenCV 3

## Setup
Create a subdirectory called `experiments`. Within `experiments`, create a folder for each experiment (ie `experiment/dd2`). An experiment is defined as a set of microscopy images taken under the same magnification and gain settings. Typically it contains multiple fields of view from one chamber slide.
